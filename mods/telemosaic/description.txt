This is a mod for MineTest. It provides teleportation pads, called "beacons". You can set the destination with a simple "key" item. This mod is lightweight for online multiplayer servers and is intended for survival games, therefore the range of the beacons is limited. To increase the range, you need to place "extenders" around the beacon. The extenders come in different patterns, allowing the extenders to form a pretty pattern - hence the name "telemosaic".
